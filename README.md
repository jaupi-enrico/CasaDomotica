## Description
CasaDomotica is a graphical demonstration program written in Java.  
It simulates how a home automation control system can function, showing how sensors, actuators, and rooms can interact inside a smart home.  
The project is intended for educational purposes and as a conceptual example of a possible control system architecture.
